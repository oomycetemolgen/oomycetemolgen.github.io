title: Oomycete Molecular Genetics Network
---

The OMGN is an international network of researchers with a focus on the molecular biology and genetics of Oomycetes.


## About Oomycetes

Because of their economic impact as plant pathogens, molecular, genetic and
genomics studies are well advanced in many oomycete species. These organisms
have served as lead species for the entire Stramenopile lineage, a major
radiation of crown eukaryotes, distinct from plants, animals and fungi. The
oomycete molecular genetics community has a strong culture of collaboration and
communication, and sharing of techniques and resources. In the late 1990s an
international network of researchers started to meet once every year and
established the Phytophthora Molecular Genetics Network. A few years later the
network was renamed Oomycete Molecular Genetics Network, abbreviated as OMGN.
With the blossoming of genetic and genomic tools for oomycetes, many new
investigators, from a variety of backgrounds, became interested in oomycete
molecular genetics and genomics. Subsequently, the network has attracted
researchers whose interests extend beyond genetics and genomics to many aspects
of oomycetes and diverse organisms with which they associate. 

## Goals

The network has the following goals:

1. Promote communication and collaboration, and minimize duplication of effort,
   within the worldwide oomycete research community.
2. Promote the entry and participation of new investigators in the field of
   oomycete genomics and biology, particularly junior faculty.
3. Foster diversity, in every dimension, within the community.

The annual OMGN meeting serves to meet these goals.

## Membership

The OMGN is open to all researchers with an interest in oomycetes and from
disciplines ranging from molecular genetics, genomics, biology, population
biology, ecology, either at an experimental or a computational level.
Investigators new to the field are always welcome, for example, those
interested in saprophytes and animal pathogens. Upon request members are
included in the mailing list <omgn-users@lists.oregonstate.edu>. Nik Gr√ºnwald
maintains this mailing list. Participants of the annual OMGN meeting should be
notified that they can subscribe to the mailing list at this website:

## [Meetings](/meetings/)

<p style="font-size: 2rem">Please join us in <a href="/meetings/2024/">2024 at Asilomar!</a>. OMGN 2024 will be held immediately before the 32nd Fungal Genetics Conference</p>

We hold annual meetings, often in conjunction with larger, more general Plant
Pathology conferences. The 2023 meeting was a satellite event to ICPP in Lyon.
