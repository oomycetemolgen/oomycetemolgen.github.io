title: About Oomycetes
---

Oomycetes are a group of superficially fungus-like organisms responsible for some of the most devastating plant diseases. Oomycete plant diseases effect many major crop species, including potato (*Phytophthora infestans*), legumes (*Aphanomyces euteiches*), and grape (*Plasmopara viticola*). Certain species also cause severe disease and destruction in natural ecosystems, including Kauri dieback (*Phytophthora agathidicida*).
