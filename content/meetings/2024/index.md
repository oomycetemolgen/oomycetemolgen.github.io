# OMGN 2024

<div style="font-size: 16pt">

We regret to inform you that the OMGN 2024, scheduled to take place from March 10th to March 12th 2024 at Asilomar Conference Grounds Pacific Grove, CA, USA, has been canceled. 
 
Based on the results of a recent survey in which the OMGN community was invited to participate, the number of researchers who expressed interest in attending the meeting is far below the number needed to cover the cost of facility and equipment use and secure the discounted rate for the hotel accommodations. The decision to cancel the meeting was made after consultation with the OMGN Steering Committee, and not made lightly. We understand the impact it may have on your plans and expectations.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause for those who have made efforts and commitment in attending the meeting. The OMGN steering committee and the organizing team is exploring alternative options, such as a meeting later this year in USA at a more cost-effective venue, and/or an informal meeting during lunch time for those who will attend the 32nd Fungal Genetics Conference. For those who have already registered, you will receive a full refund.
 
Thank you for your support, and we hope to meet you in the future OMGN meetings. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions/concerns.
